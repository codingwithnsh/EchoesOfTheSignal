# Step-to-Step Guide

This guide walks you through the process of setting up and using the project, from cloning the repository to running basic tests.

## 1. Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to place the project.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codingwithnsh/EchoesOfTheSignal.git
   ```
4. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EchoesOfTheSignal
   ```

## 2. Install Dependencies
1. Check the project’s specifications (in a requirements file, package file, or build script) for dependencies.
2. Install them using the relevant package manager or installer.

## 3. Configuration
1. Locate and review any configuration files (e.g., .env, config.json). 
2. Update the relevant fields (e.g., API keys, database URLs) based on your environment.

## 4. Running the Project
1. Execute the main script or start command:
   ```bash
   python main.py   # For Python projects
   npm start        # For Node.js projects
   ./run.sh         # Custom build script
   ```
2. Observe the logs or output to ensure the project starts or builds successfully.

## 5. Testing
1. If automated tests are included, run:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   or:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
2. Confirm that all tests pass without errors.

## 6. Deployment
1. Build or bundle the project if required (e.g., `npm run build`).
2. Deploy to your hosting environment of choice (cloud hosting, container registry, etc.).

## 7. Further Reading
- Check the [README](README.md) for an overview.
- Refer to source code documentation for deeper insights into specific modules or functions.

That’s it! You should now have the project running. Feel free to customize the steps according to your environment and requirements.
