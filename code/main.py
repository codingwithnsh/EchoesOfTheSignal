# DATA STRUCTURES
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We'll store scenes in a dictionary with keys as scene IDs. Each scene entry can
# contain:
#   - "title": A brief title or label
#   - "description": The main text or narrative
#   - "choices": A list of possible transitions from this scene
#
# "choices" is a list of dictionaries, each containing:
#   - "text": The choice text displayed to the user
#   - "next_scene": The ID of the next scene
#   - "effects": A function or lambda that modifies game state, if any
#
# Scenes are laid out to form the 20-minute storyline of the ECHO-9 station.

# We'll keep track of a global state dictionary that might include:
#   - "name": The player's name
#   - "timePlayed": A measure of progress or total time advanced in the story
#   - "morality": Some measure of moral alignment based on choices
#   - "health": Could be used if we incorporate danger or damage
#   - "inventory": Items player might pick up
#   - "visited": Scenes the player has visited
